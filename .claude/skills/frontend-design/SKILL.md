# Frontend Design Skill

## Purpose

Provides creative frontend design methodology, visual principles, and quality checklists for building distinctive, production-grade interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Process

1. **Define direction** -- Establish purpose, tone, and aesthetic before writing code
2. **Load principles** -- Read the design principles for typography, color, motion, and layout guidance
3. **Implement** -- Build working code (Angular, Flutter, or HTML/CSS/JS) aligned to the chosen aesthetic
4. **Refine** -- Verify against the quality checklist before delivery

For the complete design principles, anti-patterns, and quality checklist:

Read [reference/frontend-design-principles.md](reference/frontend-design-principles.md)

## Error Handling

If the target framework is not specified, ask the user before proceeding.
If external font/asset resources are unavailable, document the fallback choice and continue.
